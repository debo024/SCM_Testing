# Supply chain management on Blockchain 
Based on Blockchain Development


This project is based on Blockchain Development technology with implimentation of smart contracts to get final
product as a Supply Chain Management Unit.


Tech Stack:
1. Ethereum smart constracts (in solidity)
2. Rinkeby testnet
3. Truffle framework
4. Remix IDE
5. Web3.js
6. Geth


Working Protocol:
1. Manufacture requests parts from OEM.
2. OEM lists down all the parts and their details in the contract.
3. If parts are genuine and non defective the OEM gets paid.
4. Now Manufacturer starts assembling the car.


This protocol has been implemented as a smart contract, and has been optimized for the use-case of automobile supply chains.
It has been **deployed and tested** on the Rinkeby: Ethereum Test Net and in Metamask Tool.
